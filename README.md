Predicting Taxi Fares
This repository houses the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting taxi fares. By utilizing features such as pickup and dropoff coordinates, passenger count, and date/time of pickup, this project aims to provide accurate fare estimations. The dataset used for training and evaluation is described in detail, including its source, column information, and any preprocessing steps applied.
Our machine learning model was trained using Linear Regression algorithms, with hyperparameters optimized for performance. Evaluation metrics are used to assess the model's accuracy and its mean absolute error is also declared, ensuring reliable fare predictions.The project aims to provide a useful tool for predicting taxi cost.
